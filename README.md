# Hi, I'm Ts. Muhammad Nazur Syahmi 👋

I am a junior Embedded Systems & IoT engineer with hands-on experience
building proof-of-concept IoT systems involving custom hardware,
embedded firmware, and device-to-cloud data integration.

My interests focus on developing reliable, modular embedded devices
for real-world applications such as environmental monitoring,
industrial sensing, and automotive systems.
